    <h2>Welcome to</h2>
    <h1>Apache Marmotta ${MARMOTTA_VERSION}</h1>
    <h2>Installation Wizard</h2>
    <p>
      Apache Marmotta provides an open implementation of a Linked Data Platform 
      that can be used, extended, and deployed easily by organizations who want 
      to publish Linked Data or build custom applications on Linked Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wizard will guide you through a basic installation of Apache Marmotta
      for demonstration purposes. It is a fully self-contained installation, 
      meaning there are no other dependencies than Java itself. The installer 
      also installs Apache Tomcat ${TOMCAT_VERSION} for running Marmotta.
