<h1>Storage Backend: BigData</h1>

<p>
    This module provides an Apache Marmotta storage backend based on the <a href="http://www.systap.com/bigdata.htm">BigData</a>
    triple store. BigData is a highly scalable, highly performant, highly concurrent triple store implementation that you can
    use in cases where your volume of data is very high and/or you do not want/need to store your data in a relational database
    as with the KiWi backend.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The BigData triple store is licensed under
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General Public License (GPLv2)</a>. For you, this
    means that you cannot distribute custom packages making use of this backend if you do not obtain a separate license from
    Systap. For the same reason, the Apache Marmotta team also cannot offer pre-packaged distributions. However, if you
    build the distribution for your own use, you are free to use the system without additional license requirements.
