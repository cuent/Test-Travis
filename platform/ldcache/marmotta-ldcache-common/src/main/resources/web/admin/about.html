		Apache Marmotta can optionally be extended with a Linked
		Data Caching Module that transparently retrieves resources from the
		Linked Data Cloud when they are needed (e.g. when querying a relation
		to a remote resource) and caches them transparently. Linked Data
		Caching is integrated at the triple store level and thus available to
		all services accessing the triple store, including the SPARQL endpoint.
	</p>

	</h2>
	<p>The Linked Data Caching module is a powerful component for
		integrating with other Linked Data servers, either on the public
		Linked Data Cloud or from local severs deployed in an intranet. It
		provides transparent access to resources on Linked Data-aware servers.
		When enabled, it is triggered when the triples of a non-local resource
		are requested from the triple store. A typical case where this can
		happen is when a local resource links to a resource in the Linked Data
		Cloud using a triple and a query to the system requests information
		about this external resource.</p>
	<p>For example, the FOAF description of a user in the Marmotta might
		contain a reference to the FOAF file of a user at some external
		location:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
		<span class="kwd">local</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
			class="pln">peter foaf</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
			class="pln">knows </span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span
			class="pln">http</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="com">//example.com/john.rdf&gt;</span>
	</pre>
	<p>A query could then ask for all the names of persons that peter
		knows, e.g. in SPARQL:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">
		<span class="pln">SELECT </span><span class="pun">?</span><span
			class="pln">name WHERE </span><span class="pun">{</span><span
			class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">local</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
			class="pln">peter foaf</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
			class="pln">knows </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">p </span><span
			class="pun">.</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">?</span><span
			class="pln">p foaf</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln">name </span><span
			class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">name </span><span class="pun">}</span>
	</pre>
	<p>
		When evaluating the query, the Linked Data Caching module would then
		transparently retrieve the resource <em>http://example.com/john.rdf</em>
		and try to answer the query using the triples contained therein.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a id="Local_Caching"></a>Local Caching<a class="section_anchor"
			href="#Local_Caching"></a>
	</h2>
	<p>When the triple data of a remote resource are retrieved, they
		are cached locally in the Linked Media Framework's triple store in a
		special named graph called "cache", together with provenance and cache
		expiry information. The cache graph is special in the sense that
		resources in this graph are by default not considered for direct
		indexing in the semantic search (i.e. a foaf:Person retrieved from the
		Linked Data Cloud will not be returned by the Semantic Search
		component), and triples and resources in this graph are not included
		in versioning.</p>
	<p>A query to a resource is answered from the local cache as long
		as the entry is not expired, i.e. subsequent queries to a resource
		will be significantly faster than the first query as long as they are
		carried out within a certain time frame. The expiry date of a resource
		in the cache is determined in two ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>if the Linked Data server providing the original resource
			sends an "Expires" header, the value of the header defines the expiry
			date of the local cache entry</li>
		<li>otherwise, if there is an endpoint configuration for the URI
			prefix of the resource, the expiry time of the endpoint is used</li>
		<li>otherwise, the default expiry time configured in the
			configuration variable ldcache.expiry is used</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<h2>
		<a id="Modes_of_Operation"></a>Modes of Operation<a
			class="section_anchor" href="#Modes_of_Operation"></a>
	</h2>
	<p>Since the Linked Data Cloud is distributed over the Web and some
		services might not provide the reliability or availability necessary,
		or some servers are not yet Linked Data aware, the Linked Data Caching
		Module offers different modes of operation for accessing resources:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Linked Data</strong> (direct Linked Data access):
			makes use of the HTTP content negotiation to directly retrieve a
			Linked Data resource from the Web as defined in the Linked Data
			Principles. This is the default behaviour if nothing else has been
			configured</li>
		<li><strong>Cache</strong> (access to a resource or entity cache
			endpoint): retrieves the triples of a resource from a defined server
			by accessing a cache endpoint. This is e.g. useful if there is a
			local cache of a public server (e.g. to improve reliability or
			performance) or if there is a "traditional" RDF server that does not
			offer Linked Data access</li>
		<li><strong>SPARQL</strong> (access to a resource via a SPARQL
			endpoint): retrieves the triples of a resource from a defined SPARQL
			endpoint by issuing a query for all triples with the resource as
			subject. This is e.g. useful for traditional RDF servers that are
			extended by a SPARQL endpoint using e.g. Joseki or other tools.</li>
		<li><strong>NONE</strong> (block access to the resource): does
			not try to retrieve the external resource. Useful for blocking access
			for known "bad" Linked Data servers. For example, many Linked Data
			sources contain references to Wikipedia, which does not offer its
			data as Linked Data directly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>The different modes of operation can be configured as described
		below. In addition to the RDF/XML format, the Linked Data Caching
		Module also supports additional RDF serialisation formats that can be
		configured for certain Linked Data servers.</p>
	<h1>
		<a id="Configuration"></a>Configuration<a class="section_anchor"
			href="#Configuration"></a>
	</h1>
	<p>The Linked Data Caching Module can be configured using Marmotta
		configuration mechanism. The following section describes the
		configuration options used.</p>
	<h2>
		<a id="Configuration_Options"></a>Configuration Options<a
			class="section_anchor" href="#Configuration_Options"></a>
	</h2>
	<p>The following options affect the general behaviour of the Linked
		Data Caching Module:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ldcache.enabled (true/false): if set to true, transparent
			Linked Data Caching is enabled; if set to false, remote resources
			will never be retrieved</li>
		<li>ldcache.fallback (true/false): try to retrieve a resource
			using ordinary Linked Data call if no endpoint is specified; when set
			to false, this option will not retrieve any remote resources except
			those defined with endpoints; can be used to provide transparent
			caching only to some specific Linked Data servers</li>
		<li>ldcache.expiry (seconds): defines the default expiry time for
			a resource in the cache if the server does not provide an "Expires"
			header and the endpoint definition does not have an expiry time
			(default: 1 day)</li>
		<li>ldcache.fetchall (true/false): if set to true, even a query
			for all resources will include the resources that are cached locally;
			the default is set to false because this might lead to unexpected
			behaviour and crawling of the whole Linked Data Cloud if not used
			with care</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		<a id="Endpoint_Configuration"></a>Endpoint Configuration<a
			class="section_anchor" href="#Endpoint_Configuration"></a>
	</h2>
	<p>The Linked Data Caching Module allows to define URI prefix to
		endpoint mappings. These can be used to either redirect Linked Data
		queries to cache or SPARQL endpoints for improving performance or
		accessing non-Linked Data resources, or for setting different
		parameters for certain server. An endpoint definition consists of the
		following parameters:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>name</strong> (string): the public name of the
			endpoint, used for displaying</li>
		<li><strong>prefix</strong> (uri): the prefix of URIs that are
			redirected to the endpoint; if a resource requested from the cache
			has this prefix, it is handled by this endpoint</li>
		<li><strong>kind</strong> (SPARQL/LINKEDDATA/CACHE/NONE): the
			operation mode of the endpoint (see above)</li>
		<li><strong>endpoint</strong> (uri with parameters): the URI
			under which the endpoint can be accessed. Depending on the mode,
			certain parameters will be replaced by actual values in the URI:
		<ul>
			<li>CACHE: the parameter {uri} will be replaced by the actual
				URI of the requested resource, e.g. <span class="tt">http://api.sindice.com/v2/cache?url={uri}</span>
			</li>
			<li>SPARQL: the parameter {query} will be replaced by the SPARQL
				query, the parameter {contenttype} will be replaced by the MIME type
				to be requested from the server, e.g. <span class="tt">http://sparql.sindice.com/sparql?default-graph-uri=&amp;query={query}&amp;format={contenttype}</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>mimetype</strong> the MIME type to request/expect
			from the endpoint; depends on the mode of operation:
		<ul>
			<li>CACHE/LINKEDDATA: any RDF serialization supported by the
				Marmotta, e.g. application/rdf+xml, text/rdf+n3, ...</li>
			<li>SPARQL: any SPARQL result format, e.g.
				application/sparql-results+xml</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>expiry</strong> (seconds): the default expiry time
			for this endpoint if not provided by the server itself</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		<a id="Webservice"></a>Webservice<a class="section_anchor"
			href="#Webservice"></a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Endpoints are configured using the Linked Data Caching Webservice
		available under
		<span class="tt">&lt;APPDIR&gt;/cache/endpoint</span>
		; the Webservice provides the following operations for managing
		endpoints:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="tt">POST
				&lt;APPDIR&gt;/cache/endpoint?name=...&amp;prefix=...&amp;endpoint=...&amp;kind=...&amp;mimetype=...&amp;expiry=...</span>
			will create a new endpoint with the given parameters</li>
		<li><span class="tt">GET &lt;APPDIR&gt;/cache/endpoint/list</span> will return a
			list of configured endpoints in JSON</li>
		<li><span class="tt">GET &lt;APPDIR&gt;/cache/endpoint/{id}</span> will return
			the endpoint configuration for the endpoint with the given internal
			ID</li>
		<li><span class="tt">DELETE &lt;APPDIR&gt;/cache/endpoint/{id}</span> will
			delete the endpoint configuration for the endpoint with the given
			internal ID</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>In addition to managing endpoints, the webservice also offers
		two methods for retrieving resources:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="tt">GET &lt;APPDIR&gt;/cache/live?uri=...</span> directly
			retrieves a resource from the endpoints or Linked Data Cloud without
			caching it locally; used for testing endpoints</li>
		<li><span class="tt">GET &lt;APPDIR&gt;/cache/cached?uri=...</span> refreshes
			the resource with the given URI and returns nothing; the resource can
			then be retrieved using the normal resource access webservices</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>For your convenience, the Marmotta administration interface offers a
		simple UI for adding, listing and removing endpoint definitions.</p>
